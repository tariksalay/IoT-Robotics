Part 1: IoT Programming with Arduino and Raspberry Pi
Arduino and Raspberry Pi are general-purpose computer, usually with a Linux operating system, and the ability to run multiple programs. 
My projects in part 1 include:
•	Introduction to IoT & Sensors and working with basic projects
•	Arduino Based Heartbeat monitoring using Cloud platform
•	Weather Station for IoT using Arduino
•	Arduino based Motion detection
•	IoT based Arduino distance measurement
•	Raspberry Pi based Twitter Bot
•	Android IoT control

Part 2: Node-RED and Cognitive Robotics Programming with Google Actions. Modern and future robots will have enough computational power to be able to reason continuously and deeply about themselves and their environments, hands-on-experiments with programming for cognitive robotics and innovative human-robot-computer interface.
